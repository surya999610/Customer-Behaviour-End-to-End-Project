 ## Project Insights – Customer Behavior Analysis
  Overall Performance Metrics

- Total Customers: 3.9K
- Average Purchase Amount: $59.76
- Average Review Rating: 3.75 / 5

 Insight:

- The average order value (~$60) indicates moderate spending behavior.
- The average rating of 3.75 suggests customer satisfaction is good but has room for improvement.
- With nearly 4,000 customers, the dataset provides a strong base for segmentation and behavioral analysis.

Subscription Behavior
